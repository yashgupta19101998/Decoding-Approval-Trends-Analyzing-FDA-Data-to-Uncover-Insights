# Decoding-Approval-Trends-Analyzing-FDA-Data-to-Uncover-Insights

Project Overview

This project aims to analyze U.S. FDA data to identify detailed approval trends and perform segmentation analysis based on drug marketing status. Utilizing SQL for data extraction and manipulation, and Power BI for visualization, the project seeks to provide comprehensive insights into the approval processes and marketing statuses of various drugs.

Objectives

Identify Approval Trends: Analyze historical FDA approval data to uncover trends and patterns over time.
Segment Drug Marketing Status: Categorize drugs based on their marketing status to understand distribution and market dynamics.
Visualize Insights: Use Power BI to create interactive dashboards that present the findings in an accessible and visually appealing manner.


Key Activities

Data Extraction and Preparation: Use SQL to extract relevant data from FDA databases and prepare it for analysis.
Trend Analysis: Identify and analyze trends in drug approvals, including yearly approval rates, types of drugs approved, and approval timelines.
Segmentation Analysis: Segment the data based on drug marketing status (e.g., approved, pending, withdrawn) to understand market distribution.
Visualization: Develop Power BI dashboards to visualize approval trends and segmentation results, making the data easily interpretable for stakeholders.


Expected Outcomes

Comprehensive Trends Report: Detailed report highlighting key trends in FDA drug approvals.
Market Segmentation Insights: Clear understanding of the distribution of drugs based on their marketing status.
Interactive Dashboards: User-friendly Power BI dashboards that allow stakeholders to explore the data and insights interactively.
Data-Driven Decision Making: Enhanced ability for stakeholders to make informed decisions based on the analysis.
